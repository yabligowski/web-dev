        Therefore each of you must put off <span style="font-style:italic"><b>falsehood</b></span> and speak truthfully to your neighbor,<br>
for we are all members of one body. “In your anger do not sin”: <span style="text-decoration: underline wavy; color:purple">Do not<br> let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the <span style="font-weight:bolder">devil</span> a foothold.</span><br> Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, <br> that they may have something to share with those in need.<br>  <span style="font-size: x-large">Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths</span>, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, <br>that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,<br> with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander,<br> along with every form of malice. <span style="font:italic small-caps bold large cursive, monospace">Be kind and compassionate to one another</span>, forgiving each other, just as in <br><span style="text-decoration:underline wavy;color:purple;font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold">Christ God forgave you.</span>
